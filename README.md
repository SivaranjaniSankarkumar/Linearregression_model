# Linearregression_model
Supervised learning is utilized in crop production datasets to predict and optimize various aspects of farming processes.  By leveraging labeled data—where inputs (such as weather conditions, soil quality, etc.) are associated with corresponding outputs (crop yield, disease occurrence, etc.)—supervised learning algorithms .
